# what happend if a pod is killed

# 1. Run the pre-stop hook, if one is configured, and WAIT for it to finish.
# 2. Send the SIGTERM signal to the main process of the container.
# 3. Wait until the container shuts down cleanly or until the termination grace period runs out.
# 4. Forcibly kill the process with SIGKILL, if it hasnâ€™t terminated gracefully yet.

# how do we prevent broken connections when shutting down pods
# the least you can do is add a pre-stop hook that waits a few seconds, like the one in the following listing, perhaps.
